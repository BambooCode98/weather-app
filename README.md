# weather-app
A weather app that shows 5 day forecasts.

This weather app was created using the NWS public weather API and the Openweather direct geocoding API. Using these two APIs this weather app was created that shows forecasts out to five days anywhere in the United States. The app also has a dark mode that occurs whenever the forecast switches to night, otherwise it assumes the daytime format. The weather app is quite simple at this point, however, with time, or in a new app, more functionality will need to be added. 

New features that would need added to this app include: 

  1. Hourly Weather Data

  2. Weather Alerts

  3. A weather graph. 

  4. A backend for safeguarding of the API keys.

  5. A current time.

Overall, the creation of this practice weather app using APIs turned out very well. I have improved the responsive web design aspects even further in this project as the content works on all screen sizes. The styling with CSS stills needs improvement, however, it is slightly better than the previous few apps. This app will be improved as I learn new things, otherwise everything I learn will be built into a new app that contains all the features and more.
